## OpenAI-App

Simple desktop app that, currently, only handles completions. Press CTRL+M to toggle a satisfying sound effect when "Generate" is clicked. 
Completions are streamed in word by word for a more satisfying user experience.

All the credit goes to OpenAI https://openai.com/
and OkGoDoIt https://github.com/OkGoDoIt/OpenAI-API-dotnet
for making this possible!
